### Introduction

Since this year our activities are determined by the COVID-19 pandemic, the distributed computing project will be focused on the analysis of 1000 papers about COVID-19, SARS- CoV-2, and related corona viruses. The dataset is a sub-sample of 1000 items taken from the original dataset that is composed of more than 75000 papers. This dataset is a part of real-world research on COVID-19 named COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19). The research and related challenges are available on the dedicated [page](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) on Kaggle.
